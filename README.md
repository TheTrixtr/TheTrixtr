- Hi, Iâ€™m @TheTrixtr
- I'm a content creator on Twitch and YouTube
- You can find me at not_trixtr and Trixtr respectively
- I'm on github to mainly test different codes and plugins produced by other users
- I have little experience in coding;
- BUT I am taking a Computer Science course for free - secondary to my existing Uni course
- The experience I do have is in some JavaScript (From a High School course) and Markdown (From Obsidian)
<!---
If I do submit coding onto here, please feel free to let me know if there are any optimisations I could make!
